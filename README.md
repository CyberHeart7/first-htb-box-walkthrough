# Hack The Box - First Machine Walkthrough

## üß† Summary
This is a detailed walkthrough of how I hacked my first Hack The Box machine. It includes every major step I took from initial discovery to gaining access, along with notes on tools used and what I learned along the way.

## üîç **Step 1: Discovering the Target**

I started by identifying machines on the local network using `netdiscover`.

netdiscover -r 192.xxx.xx.x/24

This showed me the IP address of the machine I wanted to target. Once I had that, I moved on to port scanning.

## ‚ö° Step 2: Port Scanning with Nmap

Next, I ran a full TCP port scan using Nmap to find all open ports and grab service/version info.

![Nmap Scan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbd66e99-eb3b-450a-8d47-e53893026566)



nmap -T4 -p- -A 192.168.1.193
-T4: faster timing

-p-: scans all 65535 ports

-A: aggressive mode (includes OS detection, version info, script scan, traceroute)

The scan revealed open ports including HTTP and SMB services.

üåê **Step 3: Web Enumeration**
Since port 80 was open, I navigated to the web server and began enumerating.

Nikto Web Scanner
I used Nikto to scan for common web vulnerabilities:

nikto -h http://192.168.x.xxx
This flagged possible remote buffer overflows and code execution vulnerabilities.

DirBuster Directory Discovery
I then ran DirBuster to brute-force hidden directories and file extensions:


dirbuster &
I added extensions like .pdf, .zip, and .rar to catch more files. While DirBuster ran, I manually reviewed the page source and found a 404 page that disclosed the Apache version ‚Äî a small but useful info leak.

üîß Step 4: SMB Enumeration
Back to the Nmap scan ‚Äî I noticed SMB was running and decided to investigate further.

Using Metasploit to Identify SMB Version
I launched Metasploit and searched for SMB-related modules:

bash
Copy
Edit
search smb
Then I used the SMB version scanner module:

bash
Copy
Edit
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.193
run
This revealed that the target was running Samba 2.2.1a, which is vulnerable.

Connecting with SMBClient
I attempted to connect to the file share using:

bash
Copy
Edit
smbclient //192.168.1.193/IPC$ -N
Anonymous login worked for IPC$, though I couldn‚Äôt access admin$.

üìö Step 5: Finding Exploits
With the Samba version identified, I searched Exploit-DB and found a known vulnerability that matched. I also found a Metasploit module on Rapid7‚Äôs site that could be used to exploit Samba 2.2.1a.

I read through the exploit details and prepped the payload in Metasploit for potential use.

üõ† Tools I Used
netdiscover

nmap

nikto

dirbuster

burpsuite

metasploit

smbclient

üéØ Conclusion
This machine helped me understand:

How to enumerate live hosts and open services

When and how to use aggressive Nmap scanning

Web-based reconnaissance using Nikto and DirBuster

SMB service enumeration and exploitation research

It was a great introduction to real-world penetration testing, and it showed me how powerful a combination of tools and research can be.
